# ðŸ¤– Customer Service Bot

## Customer Service ChatBot

### Import the required libraries

```py
from beyondllm import source,retrieve,embeddings,llms,generator
```

### Setup API keys

```py
import os
from getpass import getpass
os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = getpass("OpenAI API Key:")
```

### Load the Source Data

Here we will use a Website as the source data. Reference: [https://www.lacworldwide.com.my/en/protein-and-fitness\_whey-protein/optimum-nutrition/gold-standard-100-whey-double-rich-chocolate-06100030.html?catId=protein-and-fitness](https://www.lacworldwide.com.my/en/protein-and-fitness\_whey-protein/optimum-nutrition/gold-standard-100-whey-double-rich-chocolate-06100030.html?catId=protein-and-fitness)

The goal is to have a customer service chatbot that can answer to the query based on the product data given.

```py
data = source.fit(path="https://www.lacworldwide.com.my/en/protein-and-fitness_whey-protein/optimum-nutrition/gold-standard-100-whey-double-rich-chocolate-06100030.html?catId=protein-and-fitness", dtype="url", chunk_size=512,chunk_overlap=0)
```

### Embedding model

We use `OpenAIEmbeddings`, an embedding model from OpenAI.

```py
embed_model = embeddings.OpenAIEmbeddings()
```

### Auto retriever to retrieve documents

```py
retriever = retrieve.auto_retriever(data,embed_model=embed_model,type="normal",top_k=4)
```

### Large Language Model

```py
llm = llms.ChatOpenAIModel()
```

### Define Custom System Prompt

Define the system prompt, that instructs the model to behave as a customer bot

```python
system_prompt = """ You are a Customer support Assistant who answers user query from the given CONTEXT, sound like a customer service\
You are honest, coherent and don't halluicnate \
If the user query is not in context, simply tell `We are sorry, we don't have information on this` \
"""
query = "What is the price of Gold Standard 100 Whey Double Rich Chocolate?"
```

### Run Generator Model

```python
pipeline = generator.Generate(question=query,system_prompt=system_prompt,retriever=retriever,llm=llm)
print(pipeline.call())
```

#### Output

```bash
The price of Gold Standard 100% Whey Double Rich Chocolate is RM295.00 for a 5 lb container. This is the member price, which allows you to save 32%. The usual price is RM436.90.
