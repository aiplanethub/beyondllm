Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `genai_stack` for local development.

1. Fork the `enterprise-rag` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally

    ```bash

    git add .
    git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
    ```

6. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.
